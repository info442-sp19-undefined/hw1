# Team *Undefined*

## Mission Statement

Our team mission is to develop an application that is fun, interactive, well-designed and makes a difference in society. We would all also like to achieve a score at least above 90% for the project assignments in total. Our priority is to have the application be functional and visually pleasing as well as accessible. By functional, we mean a lack to bugs and smooth interactivity. By visually pleasing, we mean a design that is clean, easy to read and makes information clear. 

## Problem Statement
The problem team Undefined will focus on is the lack of trust and communication between team members. Some events in the industry have shown that poor communication and trust is the reason why IT projects fail. Additionally, it is shown that communication between team members reflect the software quality the team is producing. If the communication is poor, then the quality will be worse and vice versa. Hence, our team decided to tackle the problem of poor communication and the lack of trust within teams. 
The scope of our problem will be lack of communication and trust within teams in college and the workplace.
