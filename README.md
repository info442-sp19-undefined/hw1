# Our Team

## Mission Statement

TODO: Your team needs a reason for being. What is its overarching goal and its overarching values? Are you trying to make the world a safer place? A healthier place? Are you just trying to get a high grade in this class? Choosing a larger purpose will focus everyone's work in the same direction and help resolve disagreements about how to spend your time, because every bit of work will serve different goals. Write your mission statement, arguing about the words as much as you need to until you come to agreement.
